(1, 'Encription', 'Security', '1', NULL, 'symmetric and assymetric algorithms', '3.1.1 Symmetric algorithms\r\nSymmetric algorithms require that the two parts share knowledge of the same secret key. This key is used for encryption and for decryption as well. It was highlighted that “This kind of encryption is typically fast and effective, but does require that the two sides share, somehow, one piece of critical information.” [33]. The systems built on symmetric algorithms are ineffective in case a large number of users need to build separate secure communication channels, because in that case the systems should manage a large number of the keys [24]. \r\nThe subset of common encryption symmetric algorithms includes the following: \r\n-	DES is built on 56-bit key and can be brute-forced by modern hardware. Therefore DES should no longer be used [24]; \r\n-	3DES is a 168 bits key encryption algorithm. It is strong enough and it was described as “popular choices for encryption of materials that do not require the heaviest-duty encryption.” [33];\r\n-	AES - Advanced Encryption Standard was appointed as algorithm for “securing sensitive but unclassified material by U.S. Government agencies and, as a likely consequence, may eventually become the de facto encryption standard for commercial transactions in the private sector” [30] AES was implemented as 192 or 256 bits key algorithm. It was described as “not hard to implement, and not memory-intensive” [33];\r\n-	Blowfish was developed in 1993 by Bruce Schneier as an alternative to existing encryption algorithms. It is faster than DES because it was designed for 32-bit instruction processors [30]. Blowfish is widely available as a native routine in many languages [33]. That may be important in case encrypted information is used by different applications;\r\n-	RC4 is an algorithm developed by Ron Rivest of RSA Security in 1987. This algorithm is most commonly used “to protect Internet traffic using the SSL protocol” [30]. One of the RC4 problems, is that “RC4’s output is easy to distinguish from a truly random stream of numbers. This problem indicates that RC4 is probably not a good long-term choice for data security.” [24] Another problem is that RC4- encrypted message could be altered in transit without detection. Therefore some authors do not recommend its use. [33].\r\n-	IDEA - International Data Encryption Algorithm is an algorithm developed at ETH in Zurich, Switzerland [30]. It is considered among the best publicly known algorithms. IDEA was patented and the patent is held by Ascom-Tech. Non-commercial use of IDEA is free. But commercial licenses must be obtained from Ascom-Tech.\r\n3.1.2 Asymmetric algorithms\r\nAsymmetric algorithms are also called public/private keys algorithms. The difference from the symmetric algorithms is that two keys are generated together, one is the Public key the other is the Private key. The Public key is freely distributed or directly sent to anyone who wants to use it for encrypting the message. That message can be decrypted only with the Private key, which should be kept in secret. In case users exchange with each other their Public keys they are able to send encrypted messages with high level of security. Security is guaranteed because of the cryptosystem’s property that “messages encoded with the Public Key of User B can only be decrypted with User B’s Private Key, only User B can read the message” [24].\r\nThe most common encryption algorithm in use today is RSA. It is built into all modern browsers, and is used when browsers build SSL connections. It was stressed that RSA “has proven resistant to all attempts to break it, despite its inventors’ having described in general terms how to do it, and despite public knowledge of exactly how it works. It has been successful partly because it uses an extremely large key; at least 1024 bits are normal for commercial applications. It is therefore, quite properly, the asymmetric algorithm of choice.” [33]. \r\nThe most common systems in use, which implement asymmetric cryptography, using RSA or other algorithms are PGP and SSL [24]. Properties of PGP system and how that system suits the needs of the interactive web sites are analysed in section 7 of this paper. The implementation of asymmetric encryption with the OpenSSL library functions is introduced in the section 7.\r\nHash functions accept text data and generate fixed-length hash as an output. The input text can’t be retrieved from the hash value. So this is one-way encryption and can be used for comparison input such as a user password against the known value such as hash of initial password in the database. Up to date MD5 and SHA-1 are common hashing algorithms. But it was pointed out that these algorithms are weak and better to be replaced by SHA-256 [24].\r\n	Essential information introduced in this section is a minimum that necessary to understand Cryptography and Encryption, Public Key infrastructure and Secure Socket Layer concepts developed in the industry. It is recommended to be aware of them in order to have a consistent view and be able to Build strategy of restricted areas protection and make choice of available SSL certificate. These areas are shown on figure 7 as areas 2 and 3. '),
(2, 'Certificate Authorities', 'Security', '1', NULL, NULL, '3.2 Certificate Authorities \r\nSecurity of transactions in e-commerce can be achieved by exploiting https protocol, which essentially is RSA system and relies on SSL certificates. SSL certificates are generated by web server and mainly consist of Public and Private keys for encryption/decryption and details about the certificate owner. With the certificate on website when web browser “points to a secured domain, a Secure Sockets Layer handshake authenticates the server (Web site) and the client (Web browser). An encryption method is established with a unique session key. They can begin a secure session that guarantees message privacy and message integrity.” [36]\r\nIn order to make certificates worldwide recognisable the trusted third parties sign certificates. It was explained that certificate authority (CA) is “an authority in a network that issues and manages security credentials and public keys for message encryption” [4]. The signing process includes different verification procedures. The list of authorised certificate authorities is built in web browsers. Thus user can check the certificate information to be sure that web site owned by a true company. The Public Key Infrastructure is the CAs together with the corresponding hardware, software, services, and processes required to support public key encryption, decryption, digital signatures, and certificates [9].\r\nThe most trusted type of CAs in PKI is root CAs. It was pointed out that “typically, both the physical security and the certificate issuance policy of a root CA are more rigorous than those for subordinate CAs” [23]. All other CAs are certified by root CAs and called subordinate CAs. According to 2007 certificate authority market report from Security Space market share of VeriSign and its acquisitions (which include Thawte and more recently Geotrust) achieved 57.6%, followed by Comodo (8.3%), and GoDaddy (6.4%) [32].\r\nThe list of the most common Certificate Authorities was included in Mozilla project Root CA and consists of the following: \r\n-	VeriSign\r\n-	Comodo \r\n-	DigiCert \r\n-	DigiNotar \r\n-	Entrust \r\n-	GeoTrust \r\n-	GlobalSign \r\n-	Go Daddy \r\n-	Keynectis/Certplus\r\n-	Network Solutions \r\n-	QuoVadis \r\n-	StartCom \r\n-	Thawte \r\n-	Trustwave \r\n-	TÜRKTRUST \r\n\r\nMany of subordinate authorities are not presented in the browsers’ list and in this case CA issues chained certificates. The main difference between chained and root certificates from developer’s point of view is that chained certificates may need more actions during installation. It was highlighted that “Any certificate in between your certificate and the root certificate is called a chained or intermediate certificate. These must be installed to the web server with the primary certificate for your web site so that user''s browsers can link your certificate to a trusted authority. Most certificate authorities use chained certificates for security purposes and most web servers and devices support them” [34]. Therefore the consultation with the web server administrator is essential especially in case of virtual hosting. For example, one of the Australian web hosting providers Webcity charges $29 for the SSL certificate installation service. But the certificate installation can be easily performed in case the hosting company provides customers with the control panel such as cPanel, this sort of administrative tool allows creating and installing SSL certificates without applying to server administrator. \r\nSeveral studies show that users don’t pay much attention to notification about security in general and even less they concern about what authority issued the certificate [41, 15]. Nevertheless businesses can improve their image by using high ranked certificates. For example, it was announced that “VeriSign is the SSL Certificate provider of choice for over 93% of the Fortune 500 and the world’s 40 largest banks” [36]. Therefore having the SSL certificate issued by famous CA contributes into prestige, but not essential for SMEs. '),
(3, 'SSL', 'Security', '1', NULL, NULL, 'Each of Certificate Authorities issues a number of different certificates, which facilitate slightly different needs. For small businesses the prime purpose of having certificate is to protect a single web site and receive a proper support service. \r\nFrom the table 1 it can be seen that all certificates support up to 256-bit encryption. It means that traffic will be encrypted with the strongest available encryption, which is supported by web server and user’s browser, however it cold be less than 256-bit. Multiple year option can be taken into account when the web provider charges the certificate installation faire.  \r\nDifferent validation procedures for different certificates lead to the different content shown on the certificate. Thus during the Business and Domain name validation both businesses and domains registries are checked, then the registered business name will be reflected in the certificate. Having such information within the certificate is not crucially important for SMEs because only low percent of users will value this information. But visual information such as the SSL certificate seal and some additional text about the security measures on the site will be important for building the customer trust. \r\nIn most cases a limited number of free reissues should be suitable because in case the key is lost or damaged during installation, one more generation could be enough for fixing the problem. In some cases the support options play an important role, but for virtual hosting and one site in business the support is essential only for the installation stage, therefore it is not the main factor when choosing the certificate. \r\nCombination of the options Free trail=“No” and Refund=”No” is undesirable because in the case some installation problems are faced there is no way to escape, except solving the problems, which depends on the web hosting provider. Despite the impressive values (up to $1000000), the warranty of the certificate is not actually very important point because it was pointed out that “The warranty that you get when you purchase a SSL certificate ($10,000, $250,000, etc...) can be misleading. It is not a warranty to the purchaser but rather to the end users who use a site secured by an SSL certificate. Basically, if you, the purchaser, turn out to be fraudulent and a user of your web site loses money because the certificate authority didn''t properly validate you, then the certificate authority will compensate the end user. This practically never happens!” [34]. So, warranty does not contribute into quality of the web system or developing process therefore large value warranty can be considered as redundancy for SMEs.\r\nThe Comodo''s EV SSL is included in the Table 1 as an example of the most recent and promising type of SSL certificates which is the Extended Validation (EV) certificate. This type of certificates includes the extensive verification during the certification procedures and the Green Bar feature. The browsers started from IE7 will change the address bar to green colour when the page is covered by a EV certificate. This measure is aimed to help users to avoid phishing sites. Assuming the fact that the phishind attacks are widely used these days, the EV certificate can be considered as an important security measure for sites with a big turnover. \r\nThe great number of certificates from different ventures are available on the market. Those, which are included into the table, show the main features and price difference between the low budget certificates and branded one, which is VeriSign certificate. \r\nEV certificate can be recommended for SMEs as the most perspective investment. If making choice between root and cheap chained certificates takes place, the fact that chain certificates are cheaper but need more installation work and consultation with web server administrator is necessary, should be taken into account.'),
(4, 'On-line PSP', 'PSPs', '1', NULL, 'Standard procedure of on-line payment with PSP', '4 On-line payment service providers\r\nSuccessful implementations of solutions, which are addressed to on-line payment issues, are available on the market. Shopping carts and payment gateway can be considered as the common features of on-line commerce applications [21]. Integration with existing shopping carts and payment gateway interfaces are often possible with payment service providers (PSP).\r\n	The Google directory contains as many as 25 companies, which facilitate the on-line payments needs [18]. According to offering facilities the companies can be classified into three categories. The following subsections introduce some features of different groups of the on-line payment providers and standard procedure of on-line payment with PSP.\r\n\r\n4.1 Standard procedure of on-line payment with PSP\r\nThe standard procedure of on-line payment completion can be described as a sequence of steps [31, 22, 8] and includes the following:\r\n1.	The customer moves to the check out with the items placed into shopping cart selected on a merchant''s Website. \r\n2.	The customer then selects "credit card" as a method of payment. \r\n3.	The customer’s browser connects to the Website host''s secure server, and brings up the secure page with a payment form. \r\n4.	The customer enters credit card information on the secure payment form and submit it. \r\n5.	The transaction information flows to the Website host''s secure server using SSL encryption.\r\n6.	The secure server connects to the merchant''s processing bank through a Secure Payment Gateway.\r\n7.	The processor polls the card network, such as Visa or Master Card, directly, and the validity of the card, and availability of funds is confirmed. \r\n8.	If the transaction''s approved, an authorization code is returned to the processor, or to the Secure Payment Gateway from the processor.\r\n9.	The authorization is encrypted by the Payment Gateway or processor and transmitted in encrypted form to the Web server of the merchant. After that the order is completed.\r\n10.	The merchant''s Web server then sends the customer''s browser a confirmation receipt. \r\n11.	The money is moved from the card holder''s bank to the merchant''s processing bank.” \r\n\r\nIt can be recommended for SMEs to consider a number of issues before choose one of the on-line payment provider to develop payment system [22]: \r\n“Questions For Internet Real-Time Processing [22]\r\n-	Integration of shopping cart or solution a business wants to use can be expensive or, in some cases, impossible. Therefore offered Secure Payment Gateway and Merchant Account should be checked for compatibility with a desired shopping cart; \r\n-	In case accepting checks is desired functionality, availability of this also should be checked, because not all providers offer this service;\r\n-	In many cases, a smaller PSP is better in providing direct support, consistent service and help to ease integration, so possibility to deal with one should be analysed; \r\n-	Virtual Terminal and Online Reporting are important and convenient facilities, so availability of this also should be checked. '),
(5, 'PSP group1', 'PSPs', '1', NULL, 'The first group of on-line payment providers', '4.2 The first group of on-line payment providers\r\n	The biggest companies such as Cybersource and Authorize.Net form the first group of on-line payment providers. These companies provide their customers with great range of services. \r\n\r\nAuthorize.Net\r\nWith Authorize.Net a customer can accept from users and manage credit card and electronic check transactions via web sites, retail stores, mail order, telephone order, call centres and mobile devices [3]. Since 1996, Authorise.Net offers services for e-commerce, therefore can be considered as one of the most reliable on-line payment providers. Statistic shows that in 2006 this company processed approximately 1.1 billion transactions and serviced more than 200000 customers [3]. Authorise.Net offers a good help services available through e-mail, on-line chat and toll-free calls. A distinguish feature of this company is that it runs Fraud Prevention Centre. Developed Fraud Detection Suit allows using a number of security options to prevent suspicious transactions executions, block specified IP-addresses, report suspicions transactions, set e-mail notification each time a suspicious transaction triggers one or more filters. Authorise.Net offers SSL certificates from COMODO Inc. on discounted rate for the customers.\r\nDevelopers, which are going to use Authorize.net products for payment system, are provided with efficient Service Selection Guide, which helps to choose from available products. \r\nPayment Gateway Standard solution from Authorize.net includes three possible ways of development. The first one is the simplest solution for SMEs are “pay now” or “donate” buttons. The code for these tools is generated automatically and requires only simple programming skills. During the generation the account owner needs only to provide the necessary information such as the item price and description. In addition, some assistance is available from integration centre. After that customer needs to copy and paste the code into the web site. Then when visitors will press the button they will be redirected to the Authorize.Net hosted page and pay securely by credit card. \r\nFor developing a more sophisticated implementation Authorize.net suggests to apply for certified developers services. This list and contact details of certified developers are available in Authorize.net certification centre. Choosing a certified developer can guarantee a high level and short time of development therefore it can be considered as a good option for SMEs.\r\nThe third possible way for SMEs is to use pre-integrated, third-party products. Available solutions include more than 120 products. The subset of the most popular includes: \r\n-	BillThru;\r\n-	I-Bill IT;\r\n-	DesignCart;\r\n-	ShopFactory;\r\n-	.netCART Shopping Cart;\r\n-	MightyMerchant;\r\n-	Auctiva;\r\n-	CashCowCart;\r\n-	Billing Circle;\r\n-	TicketTrax;\r\n-	CatalogIntegrator Cart;\r\n-	Power Service Cart;\r\n-	AuctionCheckout;\r\n-	POS/IM;\r\n-	Earth Skater Custom eCommerce;\r\n-	PDG Shopping Cart;\r\n-	X-Cart;\r\n-	VP-ASP Shopping Cart;\r\n-	RomanCart;\r\n-	GoECart;\r\n-	King Cart Services;\r\n-	AbleCommerce;\r\n-	1ShoppingCart.com;\r\n-	Interspire Shopping Cart;\r\nThese products include shopping-carts and some of them offer store building functions and inventory managing.\r\n	Payment Gateway Standard solution from Authorize.net also includes Virtual Terminal, which provides support for merchants who manually enter credit card and electronic check transactions for mail order/telephone order (MOTO) sales.\r\n	SMEs can manage their Authorize.net accounts with the Merchant Interface, which is a secure web site that allows to manage transactions, configure account settings, view account statements, generate reports and more.\r\n	In addition to Payment Gateway Standard Authorize.net offers value-adding products [3]:\r\n-	Automated Recurring Billing is a tool for submitting and managing recurring, or subscription-based, transactions;\r\n-	Customer Information Manager allows storing customers’ sensitive payment information on Authorize.net secure servers, simplifying payments for returning customers and recurring transactions. It can also help comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, since customer data is no longer stored locally;\r\n-	eCheck.Net tool allows to accept electronic checks, which expands the payment options. \r\n \r\nE-commerce tools such as call centres and mobile devices connections are useful options for big on-line stores, but not crucially important for most of SMEs. \r\nIt is important to understand that even the biggest on-line payment providers have some limitations, so Authorize.Net offers services for merchants located in the US, some others facilitate only a limited number of currencies.\r\n\r\nPayPal\r\nThe biggest on-line system PayPal, located in California, was founded in 1998 and was acquired by eBay in 2002. The company offers the following services for clients [25] in 190 countries: \r\n-	Supporting payment to anyone with an email address or phone number\r\n-	Providing secure payments on eBay;\r\n-	Providing free Tools for eBay Sellers;\r\n-	Issueing of plastic cards (PayPal plus MasterCard®);\r\n-	Installation of Express Checkout button on web site;\r\n-	Installation payment gateway on web site.\r\nWhen developing a web site with on-line payment, the acceptance the Checkout button is the basic solution and suits most needs of SMEs. The Checkout button leads users to the PayPal checkout page, which provides SSL security. Therefore in this case web site owner doesn’t need to obtain and install a SSL certificate. In case the certificate is not necessary for another site sections the certificate choice and installation issues can be left aside. The code for button is available from the PayPal site code generator and can be installed easily. \r\nHowever, PayPal charges 2.4% (rate for insignificant number of transactions) of money to be received for the sold products. Obviously the cost of the service will come to the high value in case of high turnover and eventually exceed the price of an SSL certificate. Thus own on-line payment system with SSL certificates such as Comodo’s Instant SSL Pro with price $100 per year worthwhile if the sale value exceeds $4167 and Comodo’s EV certificate with price $449 makes sense after $18708 turnover. In this basic calculation reducing certificate prices for many years certification is not taken into account as well as the price of developing an on-line payment system by the site owner. The price of developing own full-scale on-line payment system can be significant, but in many cases simple solution can be developed for SMEs and that would not add much to the site redesign and redevelopment cost. Therefore own on-line payment system can save a great amount of money in the long run for SMEs in case the limitations of such system are acceptable.\r\n\r\nGoogle Checkout \r\nGoogle offers a number of solutions for on-line payments [18]. The simplest solution is developed for orders received by phones or fax. This product - Checkout Merchant Center issues invoices and e-mails them to buyers. After that buyers follow the link provided in the email, and sign in to Google Checkout to confirm payment and shipping details. The other simple solutions are Pay Now and Donate buttons. Code for these buttons can be generated on the Google web site and then copy and paste into merchant web page. The convenient offer for developers is a test account that can be created and used for testing a developed web application. \r\nOverall the range of the offering features includes the following:\r\n-	Google Checkout Merchant Center. The Google Checkout Merchant Center is used to generate invoices and email them;\r\n-	Buy Now buttons. Buyers who click these buttons will be directed to a Google Checkout-hosted purchase page where they complete their purchases with Checkout.\r\n-	Integrating with more than 40 existing Shopping Carts;\r\n-	API for integration with developed applications; \r\n-	Google Checkout for mobile devices. No additional work required to allow customers to buy using their mobile devices. When a buyer clicks on the Google Checkout button on the site from his mobile phone, he is automatically directed to the mobile version of Google Checkout.\r\n-	The cost is 2% + $0.20 per transaction;\r\n-	Google''s comprehensive protection is free.\r\nGoogle Checkout performs industry-standard Address Verification System (AVS) and Card Verification Value (CVV) checks to prevent credit card fraud. Google Checkout also protects merchants from fraudulent activity with the following measures:\r\n-	Advanced risk modelling;\r\n-	Automatic fraud detection;\r\n-	Supplemental manual review;\r\n-	Information sharing;\r\n-	Chargeback resolution;\r\n\r\nWorldPay\r\nWorldPay company offers its services since 1993, now available in 49 countries [40]:\r\n-	Mail Order Telephone Order Payment Service with Internet Terminal. This service supports Processing payment details taken by phone, fax or mail, accepts multi-currency transactions, Hosted on WorldPay''s secure servers and demands an easy set up with no complex software to install. \r\n-	Internet Merchant Account;\r\n-	Repeat Billing for subscriptions or any type of repeat payments.\r\n-	Fraud Prevention service includes online transaction authorisation, cardholder verification (i.e. via Verified by Visa and MasterCard Secure Code), and Address Verification Service (AVS), several in-house fraud detection/protection tools that are designed to avoid hassle and minimise financial loss (including the WorldPay Guarantee which can protect you against financial loss due to fraud).\r\n-	Customer Service support. Comprehensive multi-lingual service - available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. WorldPay online managing system.\r\n \r\n\r\neWay \r\neWAY is an Australian company owned by Web Active Corporation Pty Ltd, which is a web development company that was formed in 1998. The following services are available [13]:\r\n-	Shared Payment Solution allows to process credit card transactions using eWAY’s own secure Shared Payment Page. The eWAY Shared Payment Solution is a hosted solution, meaning users enter their credit card details on the secure eWAY payment page. Only basic programming knowledge is required and it is the easiest way to link websites to eWAY gateway, and an SSL certificate is not required as the shared payment page is already secured by eWAY.\r\n-	XML Payment Solution allows users to remain on the site for the duration of their payment. Once they checkout their goods/services, all of their payment details are then passed into the background to eWAY for processing. The result of the transaction is then returned to the site in order to display and inform the users of the outcome of their payment.\r\n-	Managed Payments solution allows to upload customer''s details to eWAY, then customers can be billed as needed. eWAY securely stores these details. The billing can be initiated via XML and Web Services, or manually through Business Centre.\r\n-	eWAY supports multi-currency accounts which enable to process foreign currencies on websites.\r\n-	Antifraud tool – Beagle. Beagle provides a simple system for merchants to prevent fraudulent transactions from being processed through their website. Beagle operates primarily by allowing merchants to set their own rules based on information derived from each transaction details, including the credit card number, billing and shipping addresses, and the customers IP Address. All of this information is passed through to Beagle, which, through an extensive database system, will determine a number of fraud risk factors. The merchant’s rules are then applied to these factors to determine whether the transaction should be processed or blocked. eWAY offers two levels of fraud detection - Beagle Standard/Platinum and Beagle Lite. The basic Beagle Lite service is offered free with every eWAY account. Beagle Standard and Platinum plans are available for a small monthly fee, and offers the level of detection needed for merchants serious about preventing fraudulent transactions on their site.\r\n-	reBILL tool for periodical payments. reBILL allows to upload customers’ details once and then determine a schedule as to how long and frequently they will be charged. The reBILL XML solution provides opportunity to let customers fill in their details on the website and have the reBILL generated automatically in the background with the information provided to eWAY.\r\n-	Business Centre can be used for processing orders that have come through by phone, fax or mail order. Each manual transaction will be recorded in online reporting and an email receipt will be sent to the customer.\r\n-	vTerminal component provides developers with a server-supported, high-level interface to the eWAY payment gateway. It is designed to be integrated into existing products such as call centres, finance centres or any other application that needs a credit card processor.\r\n-	Batch payments can be used for uploading multiple credit card transactions compiled into one file. Phone, fax and mail orders can be processed through the gateway overnight once the batch file has been uploaded and will appear the following day.\r\n-	Auction Master tool allows to accept payments and managing product dispatching.\r\n-	eWAY is certified as an eBay compatible application allowing eWAY to process eBay credit card payments.\r\nThe following software can be seen as the pre-integrated solution for eWAY:\r\n-	NetMerchant (Shopping Carts)\r\n-	DIY Shopping Cart Software (Shopping Carts)\r\n-	Soholaunch (Shopping Carts)\r\n-	Optus Online Store (Shopping Carts)\r\n-	Advanced Webhost Billing System (Accounting)\r\n-	ZenCart (Shopping Carts)\r\n-	Gate13 (Shopping Carts)\r\n-	InfusionCRM (CRM)\r\n-	AShop Deluxe (Shopping Carts)\r\n-	DrewBytes Shopping Cart (Shopping Carts)\r\n-	eCorner Pty Ltd (Shopping Carts)\r\n-	Mal''s E-commerce (Shopping Carts)\r\n-	Interspire Shopping Cart (Shopping Carts)\r\n-	Bloomtools (CMS)\r\n-	Early Impact, Inc (Shopping Carts)\r\n-	VevoCart (Shopping Carts)\r\n-	EZWebSites.BIZ (Shopping Carts)\r\n-	Advanced Webhost Billing System (Billing)\r\n-	Antamedia (Billing)\r\n'),

For example keywords such as "sex", "xxx", "viagra" and others in the subject line means that most likely the message is spam and should be deleted by spam filtering software (Brain, 2008). However spammers’ techniques slowly progressed to more complex things such as “embedding a few sentences from poems and classical literature like Shakespeare.” (SpamLaws). This makes filtering a bit more difficult but still possible. \r\nThe second “bad list” that can be generated is list the of IP addresses that are used by spammers. It was pointed out that “any large spammer will have an array of server machines blasting out spam messages, and each server machine has its own IP address. Once spam is detected from an IP address, that IP address is put in a list” (Brain, 2008).\r\nFor example Spamhaus company maintains Spamhaus Block List (SBL) which is “a real-time database of IP addresses of verified spam sources and spam operations (including spammers, spam gangs and spam support services)” (Spamhaus). To get around these lists spammers change IP addresses frequently. Even more efficient way is creating "zombie machines" which send messages without owners’ permissions. For example, it is thought that recent viruses like SoBig.F were sent out specifically to recruit "zombie machines" for spammers. Most of the zombie machines are personal computers run by unsuspecting users who happened to contract the SoBig virus (Brain 2008). Spamhaus Project specialists published list of the worst Spam Service ISPs, which is shown in table 1.\r\n'),
(15, 'On-line forms', 'Spam', '1', NULL, '3 On-line forms instead of e-mails for businesses', '3 On-line forms instead of e-mails for businesses\r\nNowadays many companies use on-line forms for communications instead of e-mails. It was reported that even “the White House has been forced to follow this path. Today, if you want to send e-mail to the president of the United States, you do it by filling out an online form.” (Brain, 2008)\r\nSpecialists from HowStuffWorks web portal explain that “It used to be that you could send e-mail directly to individual HowStuffWorks staff and departments, but those e-mail addresses started to receive so much spam that we now use a set of online forms, instead.” (Brain, 2008) On-line forms help in fighting against spam because developed techniques allow to recognise robots when they try to fill on-line forms or automatically create mailbox.  \r\nThe typical approach is using one of the available CAPTCHAs, which stand for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart. This tool generates one or two words in graphical form that can’t be recognised by spammers bots. Unfortunately characters are hard to read even for humans and this fact does not increase usability.\r\nSpammers attack google mail service because gmail domain is so popular that it will not be put into some block list and spam-mails can reach targets successfully. Finally gmail.com CAPTCHA was cracked. It was reported that in the attack two hackers’ host were used and attack “involved extracting an image from a victim’s machine in the form of a bitmap file, bearing BM. file headers and breaking the code. Host 2 uses an entirely different concept wherein the CAPTCHA image is broken into segments and then sent as a portable image / graphic file  bearing  PV..X file headers as requests. Spammers seem to have a certain level of success working with different CAPTCHA breaking concepts.” (Securitylabs, 2008). \r\nAs it can be seen the CAPTCHAs technique does not give strong protection against spammers any more. Probably tests based on picture recognition will work better. The KittenAuth tool is an example of these images tests. This tool produces nine images of animals and users need to choose three with kittens. Presumably, computers will not be able to do this because appearances and postures of animals will give much more variations than possible appearances of characters. In addition, any subclass of items can be used instead of kittens (Warner, 2006).  \r\nAnother alternative to CAPTCHA tests is an audio test where a number of words or letters are spoken out loud and users need to act according to what they hear. This approach is limited due to the limitations of humans and the fact that users can work in a noisy environment (Edwards, 2008).\r\nLogical or Semantic Puzzles authentication tool can be used for detecting robots. It was pointed out that Eric Meyer''s Gatekeeper plugin for WordPress “works by asking a simple question, framed in such a way as to make it extremely difficult for machines to understand while blatantly obvious to humans.”  (Edwards, 2008). But these tools have a limited number of questions and answers, therefore they are vulnerable to brute-force attacks. \r\nMore sophisticated tools like Spam Karma perform analysis which is based on a number of factors such as time of filling the form, consistency of used language and the topic of message.

For example, Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) works with security issues in e-Security in Australia, it also gathers evidences and assists in protecting Australian users from computer frauds and identity thefts. ACMA works with Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Email Service Providers (ESPs) to improve security for Internet users. \r\nFor Internet users ACMA offers the installation of SpamMATTERS reporting system which helps to fight spam in Australia. SpamMATTERS is available to download free of charge for Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express email programs. This programm will delete spam and report it to ACMA at the same time. It was explained that “Spam reported using SpamMATTERS is used to track spammers and take action against them” (ACMA). \r\nIn addition to protection against and reporting spam in the mailboxes, users, who use FTP connections in their activities, need to undertake some extra steps. The problem, as it was reported by server administrators, is that attackers often aimed for FTP connection passwords. Control over FTP connection provides spammers with access to the mail service. In general, weak users’ passwords are easy to crack by guessing, in addition hackers use malware for sniffing FTP transmits. Because FTP transmits are not encrypted even the proper passwords are vulnerable. Due to this reason encrypted connections are preferable such as SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) or (FTP over SSL/TLS). Open-source FTP clients FileZilla and PuTTY_PSFTP, which provides this functionality are available for download. (Spamhaus, FileZila).'),
