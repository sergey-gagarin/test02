  <h1>Validation</h1>

    <p>(from<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#strict">source</a>)
    Validation is a process whereby documents are verified against the associated DTD, 
    ensuring that the structure, use of elements, and use of attributes are consistent 
    with the definitions in the Document Type Declaration (DTD).</p>
    
    
  <p>
    <ol>
      
      <li>Validation is vital to have the site will be rendered consistently in different browsers.</li>
      <li>Validation is the first step towards SEO as valid markup is easier to read for search engines</li>
      <li>Faster loading as users' agents do not need to fix the pages</li>
      <li>Validation helps to avoid hacks so it provides forward-compatibility</li>
      <li>Validation helps maintain the site later on</li>
      <li>Validation saves time. Visual check in different browsers could not be enough as browsers do their best to represent 
    the page with broken tags, but as more code added the best efforts could not be enough 
    to fix all the problems. Even if the last bit of added code is correct,
    it still can look ugly because of the previous bit. So it is hard to identify 
    the problem. All the browsers will reflect the valid design in the same way 
    (or close enough), but they will show different results for invalid page. 
    To save the time it is wise to validate the page instead of try to
    fix it with different tricks while it is still invalid and therefore no guaranty 
    it will be represented correctly with the next bit of code added.</li>
      <li>Validation is a start for passing Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) test.</li>
      <li>Validation icon on the page will prove that designer follows professional standards</li>
    </ol>
  </p>


  But in case validation is not crucial
     and advance HTML 5 tags can not be replace, declear &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt. 
     even if the validation is not available for HTML 5 it is good to check that 
     browser renders the page with standards compliance mode (Tools / Page Info / Render Mode).
  Check for Quirk Mode !
  see http://localhost/01_test/test_BoxModel/box_model.html for Quirk mode - Tools /  Developer tools

Compatibility (from http://html5doctor.com/absent-elements-and-validation/ )
In terms of backwards compatibility there is no reason why you couldn't start
 using new HTML 5 elements in your HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.x documents, it could 
 even be described as progressive enhancement. For example, why not include the <video> element? 
 It won't validate but maybe that doesn't matter? 
 
 pave cowpath principle:

 When a practice is already widespread among authors, consider adopting it rather than forbidding 
 it or inventing something new.
