   <p style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size: 20px; margin: 20px;"> font-family:  sans-serif. Generic font family.(no little feet)
  <br> Although popular in print, serif fonts fare less well online. If using serifs, ensure you render
       them large enough so that they don’t break down into an illegible mess.</p>
  
  <h1> fonts 2 </h1>
  
  <p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 20px; margin: 20px;"> font-family:  Georgia. 1.
  <br> Georgia is perhaps the best available web-safe serif, especially when used at sizes equivalent to
      12 pixels and above, and it can be more suitable than a sans-serif if you’re working with
      traditional subject matter, or if you’re attempting to emulate print articles (such as in the
      following screenshot of the online column Revert to Saved; www.reverttosaved.com).</p>
      
      <p>
      Georgia: Pretty common, again predominately a Microsoft font. I feel it has a lot of character, nice Serifs, 
      and big and fat body. Like Verdana, Georgia was specifically designed for on-screen reading for any size. 
      Comes off as professional, but not quite as serious as Times New Roman.
      </p>
  
  <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px; margin: 20px;"> font-family:  Times New Roman. 2.
  <br> The other commonly available serif font, Times New Roman (Times being a rough equivalent
        on Linux systems), is inferior to Georgia, but worth using as a fallback. Like Arial, its
        popularity is the result of its prevalence as a system font.</p>
        <p>Very common on all platforms; one of
the most common serif fonts. Comes off very traditional, professional,
and/or serious. </p>

  <p style="font-family: Times; font-size: 20px; margin: 20px;"> font-family:  Times. 3.
  <br> The other commonly available serif font, Times New Roman (Times being a rough equivalent
        on Linux systems), is inferior to Georgia, but worth using as a fallback. Like Arial, its
        popularity is the result of its prevalence as a system font.</p>

  
   <p style="font-family: serif; font-size: 20px; margin: 20px;"> font-family:  serif. generic.
  <br> Although popular in print, serif fonts fare less well online. If using serifs, ensure you render
        them large enough so that they don’t break down into an illegible mess.</p>
        <p>These fonts are considered more traditional, or "book-ish", as serif fonts were designed specifically to read well in print. The serifs (those "little feet") on the appendages of the letters form subtle lines for your eyes
to follow.</p>

    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 20px; margin: 20px;"> font-family:  Courier New. 2.
  <br>Courier New: This is a mono-spaced font, based on the old typewriters and often what your HTML and text editor prefers to display (the point of mono-type is that the characters don't merge together, so it's easier to see your syntax). As a result of that association, I usually reserve this font for presenting code snippets or technical definitions within my designs.

    <p style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 20px; margin: 20px;"> font-family:  Verdana.  GOOD ONE_!
  <br> This font is common on every platform and was specifically designed for web reading at smaller web sizes. When you really want to use a san-serif font for your body text, this is your best bet.
  </p>
  
    
    <p style="font-family: Tebuchet; font-size: 20px; margin: 20px;"> font-family:  Tebuchet.
  <br> Fairly common now-a-days, and a pretty popular font on
    "Web 2.0" styled sites. Clean like Arial with a lot more character. It reads a little better at smaller sizes than Arial. This was originally a Microsoft font, so sometimes it doesn't appear in older Mac or Linux OSs. (Verdana is a MS font too, originally released with IE 3, but its design for screen readability
    got it opted quickly by other OSs.)
