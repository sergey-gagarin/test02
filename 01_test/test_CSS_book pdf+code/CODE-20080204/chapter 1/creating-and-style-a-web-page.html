    <p>A paragraph of text, which is very exciting&mdash;something that will live on through the generations.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;A quote about something, to make people go "hmmmm" in a thoughtful manner.&rdquo;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Another paragraph, with equally exciting text; in fact, it&rsquo;s so exciting, we're not sure it&rsquo;s legal to print.
    
    When submitting a form through normal means, you must specify in the form tag
whether you wish to pass along the values in a GET or POST type of environment. The decision
of which method to use is a rather important one. Submitting a form using the GET
method will pass the content of all form elements along as a query string. What this
means is that the browser will assemble all submitted fields into one long string value,
and then pass the string along to the script designated in the action attribute. The problem
with using the GET method is twofold. The first issue concerns the length of data that
can be passed. Sadly, the GET method allows you to pass only so much information in the
query string. The length of the allowed query string can differ depending on the browser
that’s being used; however, it’s just not long enough to handle the majority of web applications.
The second issue with GET comes into play when using dynamic database queries
that are based on information received from the GET request. Say, for instance, you have
a database script set up to delete a record upon the click of a link. Now, let’s say that a
search engine happens to encounter said link and clicks it. If you haven’t set up the script
to properly handle such an eventuality, you could quickly find your information missing.
