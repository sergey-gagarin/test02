Rinnai revolutionised the Australian water heating market in the early 90's when 
it launched the first fully electronic gas Continuous Flow hot water system.

Appropriately named the Rinnai INFINITY because it never ran out of hot water, 
today systems are even more sophisticated ' designed with the environment in mind 
with low emission burners, high efficiencies and low flow rates compatible with water 
saving (WELS) outlets and showers.
